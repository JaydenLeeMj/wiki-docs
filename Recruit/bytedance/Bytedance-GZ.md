# Backend Engneering


核心竞争：
- 技术-工程能力
- 应变能力：
- 履历: 
- 有限沟通：属于软件技能，如How-to展现表达自己的业务设计(言简意赅)

语言选择： 
- Golang: 0
- Python: 70
- Java: 80
- 不会再新增了


功能能力：是否对业界了解足够多；如微服务，云原生
Java最为最核心的技能，coding skill
构建复杂应用-设计方案，


Hardcore: coding skills, 算法，源码和练习
工程能力：属于能否落地项目的能力，需要靠项目的积累
系统设计：这个模拟不来，需要需要阅读，和模拟; 了解设计的大原则
运维能力：不依赖运维人员也能走的转

以上都还只是技术层面的东西，对于公司和团队来说还不是最终的，最重要的是理解业务的能力和选择合适技术做应用.

Honetsly, nothing is easy，但是也不是复杂到实现不了，最重要的是知道大环境和知道自己的现在定位和即将去往的位置，以及这两者之间的差距；

```text
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, 
it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, 
it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, 
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, 
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, 
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, 
we were all going direct to Heaven, 
we were all going direct the other way – in short, 
the period was so far like the present period, 
that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, 
for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
